I looked at various options for ordering / grouping the Black Hammer (and World of Black Hammer) comics.  Phases, release order, library order, TPB order, splitting core and world, etc.

In the end I settled on using the Trade order from [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackHammer/comments/1e2hn9m/comment/ld8kisc/).  It makes a good argument for the placement of Unteens before Reborn, though I'm not entirely convinced by the flashback nature for things like the Giant Sized Annual and #12.

I've then added any new series to the end in release order
