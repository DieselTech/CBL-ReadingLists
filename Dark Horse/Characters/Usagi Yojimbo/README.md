Usagi Yojimbo (Issues): The typical Reading List, I used the Trades story-order for this order. I used the more modern re-releases as well which are easier to get a hold of than the old anthology issues these stories originally appeared in.

Usagi Yojimbo (Color): Darkhorse is slowly re-releasing the original issues now in full-color. These are not 1:1 with the old issues as some are consolidated from the various anthologies.

Usagi Yojimbo (Books): Basically the Trade collections. This was created mainly because of how tricky it is to get the order when using ComicVine metadata. Much like Hellboy, the trades are the suggested modality for reading. Or the collected Saga editions for those Books that have been collected thus far.
